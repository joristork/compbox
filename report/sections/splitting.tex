As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:design} we split the source code on two levels.
\begin{itemize}
\item The code is split in functions.
\item Each function is split in \emph{basic blocks}.
\end{itemize}

The blocks of each frame are stored in a \emph{control flow graph} (cfg). The edges in this graph correspond to possible branches.

Splitting in blocks is implemented in \code{cfg.py}.
