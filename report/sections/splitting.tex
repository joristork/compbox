We split the source code on two levels.
\begin{itemize}
\item The code is split in functions. We call such a code block a \emph{frame}.
\item Each frame is split in \emph{basic blocks}.
\end{itemize}

The blocks of each frame are stored in a \emph{control flow graph} (cfg). The edges in this graph correspond to possible branches.
