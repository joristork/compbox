In this report, we describe our implementation of a ``peephole'' code optimiser.
Such an optimiser scans and performs transformations on a ``peephole'' of source
code, i.e.\ on a sliding sub-sequence of instructions in that source code. The
function of a peephole optimiser is to improve a computer programme at
compile-time by reducing its typical resource footprint in terms of CPU time,
memory size, or both CPU and memory usage. The peephole optimiser assignment
concludes our undergraduate course on compilers at the University of Amsterdam.
