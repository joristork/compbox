Note that, for all tests, we entered $100$ at both prompts for values in
\texttt{slalom}. Use command line option \code{-v} to see more statistics.

\subsection{Discussion}
While we performed dataflow analysis and liveness analysis, we could only 
implement a basic optimalisation based on the liveness information. With more
time, we could have gotten a huge performance boost using the gained data. We 
produced a very nice framework for optimalisations: all essential data is
gathered and optimalisations are done in a way that we can expand very easy. 
Unfortunatly the optimalisations we implemented still need some finetuning.
